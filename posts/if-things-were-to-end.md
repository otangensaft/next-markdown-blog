# If Things Were to End

If things were to end tomorrow, how differently would I do things? Would I care about the same things I care about doing today? 

## Family

The first thing I would do differently is prioritize the time I have spent with my family.  Perhaps this is a result of most of my life being defined by their presence, meaning that I am living in the past, but I think that my youth is some of the most formative years of my life, and I owe it to my family for where I am today. 

Things have not always been smooth sailing with each member of my family, particularly with my dad.  But there is a difference between not getting a long and harboring resentment. A young tree, when its roots are impeded by a rock, grows best when it flows past its obstacle rather than confront it head on.  As time progresses, the trees roots grow in strength and are able to overcome the rock/obstacle by either shifting it or breaking it.  

Obstacles in life, particularly with family members, are inevitable. You do not choose your parents, and your parents do not choose the person you are to become. Your compatibility with your parents is unlikely at best, but what you do give up in potential amicability, you instead gain in mutual understanding that it is okay to be different -- and it is okay to still love one another even despite your differences.

Often as we grow older and leave the nest, it is easy to forget where we came from and the people who raised us. Not only is that a disservice to them, it is also a disservice to us to not appreciate oft-forgotten love and care that has gone into our individual development.
