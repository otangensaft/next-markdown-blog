<!-- Thesis: Priorities would change if things were to end -->


If things were to end tomorrow, how differently would I do things? Would I care about the same things I care about doing today? 

Likely, I would do  things differently.  I would spend more time with my family, try to care more for my friends, and be open to pursuing my dreams. On the flip side, I would spend less time worrying about my career, money, and what others think of me.

## Family

The first thing I would do differently is prioritize the time I have spent with my family.  Perhaps this is a result of most of my life being defined by their presence, meaning that I am living in the past, but I think that my youth is some of the most formative years of my life, and I owe it to my family for where I am today. 

Things have not always been smooth sailing with each member of my family, particularly with my dad.  But there is a difference between not getting along and harboring resentment. A young tree, when its roots are impeded by a rock, is best served by growing around the rock rather than trying to beat its way through it.  

Obstacles in life, particularly with family members, are inevitable. You do not choose your parents, and your parents do not choose the person you become. Your compatibility with your parents is unlikely at best, but what you do give up in potential amicability, you instead gain in mutual understanding that it is okay to be different -- and it is okay to still love one another even despite your differences.

Often as we grow older and leave the nest, it is easy to forget where we came from and the people who raised us. Not only is that a disservice to them, it is also a disservice to us to not appreciate the love and care that has gone into our individual development.

As we shift from childhood to adulthood, it is equally important that we take the time to care for those that need guidance. I think to my niece, and how these years will serve as some of the most formative years of her development. Properly raising a child isn't easy, but becoming an adult necessitates responsibility whether we like it or not.  This means equipping Belle with  the tools necessary to succeed on her own, hopefully long after I am gone.  

## Friends

Unlike family, friends are people that you aren't predestined to involve yourself with. It would logically follow then that you choose your friends. But, that is not the case.  You don't choose your friends, they don't choose you, they happen to happen without you realizing it in the moment.

The fact that friendships just happen, without any intention, somehow makes it all the more meaningful. A lot of important things in life can and should be planned, but that is not the case with friendships.

The best way to develop friendships isn't to grasp at it, but rather to fall into it. The harder we try, the less natural it will be. But the moment we let go of our desires and who we want to be, is when we can be a part of a relationship that is much deeper and more fulfilling than anything we could become in isolation. 

As with most valuable things, the greatest mistake you can make with friendships is to take them for granted. While the friendship isn't something you should try for, the acknowledgement of mutual significance in each others' lives is something that must be actively articulated. Rarely are the things we regret the things we did.  Rather, the things we regret are that which we didn't do. So take the time to let your friends know how much they matter. 

## Dreams

No heart has ever suffered in search of its dreams.
