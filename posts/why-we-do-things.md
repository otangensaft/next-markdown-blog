## Why We Do Things

There are two reasons that people do things.  Either to enjoy the present moment, in anticipation that it will yield a better future.  Perhaps both.  

Focusing only on the present is short-sighted.  It is hard to enjoy a present when anxious about the future.  

Focusing solely on the future is foolish, as there is little use in creating a better future that we do not enjoy.

## Present vs Future

That begs the question -- when should we prioritize the future? 

We should prioritize the future when our vision of the future, supercedes our present moment.  A vision is a future reality that has yet to be created, so to prioritize it over our current reality, the future reality must be more important.

Looking back, Rosa Park's vision of a more equal future superceded the immediate suffering she experienced in a jail cell.

Once the a vision has been properly defined, the concern shifts from defining the vision, to achieving it.  

## How to realize a better future

The best way to predict the future is to create it.  But in order to do so, the proper planning must be done.  Here are the proper steps

  1. Articulating the Vision
  1. Building a Team
  1. Follow-Through
  1. Knowing What Done Looks Like

## Articulating the Vision

To guarantee the best outcome, it is critical that success if clearly defined.  Not just for the person in charge, but for all those involved or are effected by the consequences.

## Building a Team

If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together. - African Proverb

Nothing of importance can be done alone in this modern era.  Building the right team, and sharing a common vision is critical to achieving tangible progress.

### Coaching

In order to execute on the vision, the team has to fire on all cylinders and in unison.  Management and coaching exists to unleash the potential of each individual.  But the right things must be done at the right time, and that required proper planning.

### What Role Do We Play? 

For matters of importance, the roles are defined by the work that must be done.  A doctor better serves as a barista when no one is sick.  Roles exist to fulfill a vision, not the other way around.  The role you play is the one that best fulfills on your promise of realizing that vision.

## Follow-Through

If we are to sacrifice the present in order to realize a better future, it becomes incumbent upon us to ensure that the future is properly realized.  It's only a dream until you do it.  But that means you have to do it.  This is the hard part.

### Goals and Milestones

Goals and milestones must be defined as intermediary steps to track progress on achieving the vision.  Goals should be clearly defined, measurable, and have a deadline.  Milestones are important goals that track tangible progress towards the vision.

## Knowing What Done Looks Like

A large issue isn't there not being enough, but rather there being too much.  Too often, we finish what we set out to do, only to continue the same actions without remembering why we did it in the first place.  Not only must we define success in the beginning, it is equally important to recognize a job when it done.
