<!-- Thesis: The Greatest Waste is the Waste of Human Experience -->

It was not alwayst the case that we valued human experiences, or human lives for that matter. We would  hang people for stealing a loaf of bread. But as society advanced, so too did its values

Only recently did we conceive of a radical concept -- that human beings, each have an unalienable right to life. When you tell individuals they mean something, they live up to it. Believing in the value of human beings, we unleashed an unbelievable era of human prosperity, making cars, trains, and planes do the work that was previously carried on the back of individuals. 

Unfortunately, along with this material abundance came with a gluttony of overconsumption, with Americans no longer being referred to as "American Citizens," but rather "American Consumers." In desperately escaping the hovels of material scarcity, humanity overstuffed itself with fleeting pleasure.

So, what is it then that we should value, if not for the material things? Traditionally we value things that are scarce (e.g. land). But, while the new car we purchase may be limited in quantity, there is one thing in our lives that is truly one of a kind -- our individual human experience.  

No one will ever be able to live the same life as you. No other person will ever be able to help those that you have surrounding yourself. You live in a constellation of temporary coherence, a permutation that will never repeat itself.

While our individual experiences are distinct, they can weave together to create a tapestry of far greater significance than what we accomplish ourselves.  In coming together to place a person on the moon, it stood for more than the experience of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin -- it represented a collective effort of humankind -- a tapestry individual experiences that will never be replicated.  

The decisions we make affect not only ourselves, but also those we surround ourselves with as well.  In how we treat others, we stitch together a fabric that not only defines the experiences of others, but also defines us as well.  

Looking forward, we each carry a unique responsibility to weave the best version of ourselves into the rich tapestry of our collective human existence.
