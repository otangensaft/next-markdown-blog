<!-- Thesis: The future supercedes the present if the vision is that important -->

## Why We Do Things

There are two reasons that people do things.  Either to enjoy the present moment, in anticipation that it will yield a better future.  Perhaps both.  

Focusing only on the present is short-sighted.  It is hard to enjoy a present when anxious about the future, but it is unwise to focus solely on the future, as there is no point in realizing a future that we do not take the time to cherish. 

## Present vs Future

That begs the question -- when should we prioritize our vision of the future over the present moment?  

That is a question that I do not have the answer to -- it depends on the circumstances of each individual.

A vision is simply an imagined reality that has the potential to exist.  For it to take precedence over our current reality, the potential of turning that vision into a reality, must supercede our immediate reality.

This happens faily often.  For instance, Rosa Park's vision of a more equal future superceded her immediate suffering.  She was willing to sit in jail, with the hope that it would yield a future where people could sit together.
